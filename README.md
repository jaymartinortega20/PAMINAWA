INTRODUCTION
Rationale of the System
Our open audio streaming application aims to offer students an impressive music catalog for relaxation and studying without interruptions from ads or low sound quality.
In-depth research shows that music has the ability to divert attention from stress and aid in increasing focus.
There are millions of paid streaming services available but their subscription fees are sometimes unable to be justified.
Payment barriers prevent students from accessing various free options that include restrictions like sound quality, ads, and access.
Our application solves these problems by creating an eco-system where students can enjoy relaxing and concentration boosting music without financial limitations.

While there are a few challenges with developing our app like offline streaming and internet dependency, we have a developed a plan to overcome them.
First, we aim to optimize the app for low bandwidth connections, alongside developing an offline mode which will expand our audience.
Second, collaborating with independent artists and free music platforms will aid us in legally expanding our collection.
Offering optional non-intrusive ads or accepting donations will help fund these developments.
Regular updates and maintenance will ensure the application remains functional and user-friendly.

We hope to tackle the challenge of providing a stress-free and productive environment for studying via an audio streaming service that covers all the features accessibility and quality. 

Objective

Our intention with the PAMINAWA app is to make students have access to music that would be a relaxing distraction, as well as a part of concentration while studying. We would like to provide an entertaining ad-free experience along with their good audio quality for study purposes. There are abundant paid streaming services but most subscription rates are expensive for students. Our app seeks to furnish all these by having an open collection platform for students where they can enjoy high quality listening at no expense.

It will be our goal to keep adding to the app's features in the future with the collection of more music libraries and making this app suitable for students' learning needs, including routine updates to the application whilst ensuring that it can be used and enjoyed as simply as possible. 

Scope and Limitations

The app aims towards a general audience rather than focusing on a particular group at any given time. A simple example would be calling the app as "PAMINAWA"  and partly defining that it has something for everyone. This would add another demographic. While it is clear that the greatest concentration within the app would be on an extensive collection of music organized for study-triggering focus and stress-relieving, it would still include quite a diversity in styles with an emphasis on tracks intended for relaxation and concentration-aiding.

Not only that, but the app is being designed and developed for a particular target group and that applicant is students who study at homes or hostels and also travel frequently, thus this app is for students who are always on the go. Besides, we are working on making the whole app offline for downloading. The app will mostly function with an internet source for streaming, and for users with low connections, we really optimize it but for those who have kept the connection somewhat, you may find challenges. Funding is a separate challenge as well. We shall have optional ads and donations to pay for the app over time, but keeping it entirely free while still providing quality service was going to be a challenge. In summary, we intend to do our best in improving our app regularly such that it undergoes checks for possible faults, becomes user friendly, and will ever be a place where students can relax from the rigorous tension brought on by academia and be productive.
